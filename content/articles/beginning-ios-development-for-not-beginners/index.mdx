In this video, I’m going to show you how to get started making iOS apps by building a basic Rock, Paper, Scissors game.

We will be writing a little bit of Swift, so to get the most out of this video, you should be familiar with some sort of programming language. You don’t have to know Swift, but you should know what things like functions and classes are.

In this video, I’m not going to go into depth about Swift programming language or go over all the details about iOS development. I will definitely cover everything in much more depth in other videos, but this video is just about giving you enough so that you can start tinkering around with basic iOS apps without getting overwhelmed.
