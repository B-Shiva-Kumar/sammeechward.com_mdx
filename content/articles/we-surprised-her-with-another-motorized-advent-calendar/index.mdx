My 16-month-old daughter and I built an advent calendar for her mother for Christmas. It uses a linear actuator and an iPhone app to push out a box of candy each day.

Check out my advent calendar from last year:

We used a linear actuator, arduino nano, motor driver l298n, and raspberry pi zero w. Leave me a comment if you want to know any other details about how I built it.
