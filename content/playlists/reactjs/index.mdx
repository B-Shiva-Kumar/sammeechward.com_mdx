## All You Need To Know About React.js

Not sure if content should go here, like a playlist description or some shit. I mean I have complete control here, so do I just list the videos or do something fancy?

I could put an unlisted video that explains the playlist?

At some point I think it would be cool to make playlists where half the videos are member only videos and instead of selling courses, I just get people to become channel members to get these plyalist courses.

I might put a sidebar on the left so you can click on a video and keep track of where you are.
