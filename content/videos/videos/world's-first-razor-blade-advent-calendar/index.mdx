An advent calendar that uses razor blades to unlock doors, not an advent calendar filled with razor blades.

This year, I decided to make my girlfriend April an advent calendar full of her favorite candy. But I had to make sure that she wouldn't be able to just open up a door and take candy whenever she wanted. I needed the calendar to lock each door and only unlock one door each day in December.

My semi-successful solution was to tie each door to the calendar using a peice of string. Then I connected a razor blade to some CNC parts and had the stepper motor move the motor and cut the string, releasing the door for that day.
